# flask-by-example
A flask app that implements a RedisQueue, AngularJS Frontend and Heroku Cloud. Good practice that allowed me to implement a 
Flaks app in local, staging and prod environments on the Heroku Cloud.

# Inspiration
Wanted to get experience with Redis Queues on a Python Environment. I found this amazing 8 part [tutorial](https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/)
that walks you through the entire process in addition to setting it up on the cloud.

Here is the [GitHub Link](https://github.com/realpython/flask-by-example/releases) for the original tutorial

# Takeaways
- How Redis Queues work using RQ
- Developing an application for local, staging and production environments on the Heroku Cloud
- Basics of Flask Apps
  - Sending Data between forms
  - Redirects
- Light refresher on AngularJS

# Setup
```bash
pipenv install
